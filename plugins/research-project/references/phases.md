# Research Project Phases

## Overview

Research projects typically progress through distinct phases. Each phase has specific goals, activities, and completion criteria. This guide helps track progress and determine when to transition between phases.

## Phase Definitions

### Phase 1: Planning

**Goal**: Define research questions and establish project foundation

**Activities**:
- Formulate research questions
- Review existing literature
- Define hypotheses
- Plan initial experiments
- Set up project structure

**Completion Criteria**:
- Research question clearly stated in STEERING.md
- At least one testable hypothesis formulated
- First experiment planned in tasks.md

**Typical Duration**: 1-2 weeks

---

### Phase 2: Exploration

**Goal**: Initial data analysis and hypothesis refinement

**Activities**:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis
- Refine hypotheses based on initial findings
- Identify key variables and relationships
- Establish analytical methods
- Create pilot experiments

**Completion Criteria**:
- At least 2-3 lab notebooks completed
- Hypotheses refined based on initial observations
- Analytical approach validated

**Typical Duration**: 2-4 weeks

---

### Phase 3: Execution

**Goal**: Systematic experimentation to test hypotheses

**Activities**:
- Run planned experiments systematically
- Document all procedures and results
- Iterate on hypotheses as needed
- Collect comprehensive data
- Perform quality control

**Completion Criteria**:
- All planned experiments completed
- Results documented in lab notebooks
- Data quality verified
- Hypotheses evaluated

**Typical Duration**: 4-8 weeks

---

### Phase 4: Integration

**Goal**: Synthesize results into coherent reports

**Activities**:
- Generate integrated reports from lab notebooks
- Identify patterns across experiments
- Create final figures and tables
- Write comprehensive analysis
- Prepare documentation

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] At least one integrated report completed
- [ ] Key findings clearly articulated
- [ ] Supporting evidence organized
- [ ] Limitations acknowledged
- [ ] Report passes quality checklist (see `references/quality-standards.md`):
  - [ ] All claims linked to evidence (notebook/figure/table)
  - [ ] Statistics complete (test name, n, effect size, p-value)
  - [ ] Figures/tables have proper axes, units, legends, error bars
  - [ ] Reproducibility block included (environment, dependencies, commands, data sources)
  - [ ] Facts clearly separated from interpretation

**Typical Duration**: 2-3 weeks

---

### Phase 5: Publication

**Goal**: Prepare results for dissemination

**Activities**:
- Write manuscripts or technical reports
- Create presentations
- Prepare supplementary materials
- Review and refine documentation
- Archive code and data

**Completion Criteria**:
- Final manuscript/report completed
- Code repository finalized
- Data archived with documentation
- Project retrospective conducted

**Typical Duration**: 2-4 weeks

---

## Phase Transitions

### Transitioning Between Phases

1. **Review completion criteria**: Check if current phase criteria are met
2. **Update STEERING.md**: Document phase transition with date and notes
3. **Plan next phase**: Define priorities and next actions
4. **Archive phase artifacts**: Ensure all work is properly documented

### Flexible Progression

Phases are not strictly linear:
- May return to earlier phases based on findings
- Can work on multiple phases simultaneously
- Duration varies by project complexity
- Some phases may be skipped for small projects

### Phase Update Workflow

When updating phase in STEERING.md:

```markdown
## Phase History

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Notes |
|-------|------------|----------|-------|
| Planning | 2025-01-01 | 2025-01-15 | Initial setup and question definition |
| Exploration | 2025-01-15 | - | Current phase |
```

## Phase-Specific Best Practices

### Planning Phase
- Write down research questions before coding
- Start with "why" not "how"
- Make hypotheses falsifiable

### Exploration Phase
- Document unexpected findings
- Don't ignore negative results
- Update hypotheses based on data

### Execution Phase
- Follow established procedures consistently
- Document deviations from plan
- Perform regular quality checks

### Integration Phase
- Separate facts from interpretation
- Acknowledge all limitations
- Link claims to evidence

### Publication Phase
- Make code and data reproducible
- Write for your future self
- Include context for decisions
